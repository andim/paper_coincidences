It allows reproduction of the statistical analyses and numerical results reported in the manuscript.

For a number of figures final assembly and cosmetic changes were done in Inkscape as a postprocessing step. In these cases the figures will not be reproduced precisely. To help reuse the final edited figures are provided in png/svg format.

## Installation requirements

The code uses Python 3.6+.

A number of standard scientific python packages are needed for the numerical simulations and visualizations. An easy way to install all of these is to install a Python distribution such as [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

- [numpy](http://github.com/numpy/numpy/)
- [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
- [pandas](http://github.com/pydata/pandas)
- [matplotlib](http://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
- [seaborn](http://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)

Additionally the code also relies on the following package:

- [pyrepseq](https://github.com/andim/pyrepseq)
